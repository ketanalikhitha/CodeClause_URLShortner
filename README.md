# URL SHORTNER
URL SHORTNER MEANS SHORTENING THE BIG URL INTO SMALL URL.
FOR AN EXAMPLE, LET US OPEN A WEBSITE NAME COURSERA, IT HAS BIG URL. SO, COPY THE URL AND PASTE INTO THE "ENTER THE LINK HERE" AND CLICK THE BUTTON "SHORTEN".
FROM THAT WE GET A SHORT LINK FROM THE RESULT.
COPY THE LINK AND PASTE INTO A NEW TAB AND WE GET A SAME WEBSITE.
THIS IS ONLY SHORTENING THE URL. IT ALSO USEFUL FOR ANY SOCIAL MEDIA OR WEBSITE PLATFORMS FOR ADDING INTO THEIR BIO OR RESUMES.
